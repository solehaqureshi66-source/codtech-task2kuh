# Library Management REST API

This project is created as part of CodTech Internship Task-2.
The objective of this project is to design a RESTful API using Python
and Flask for a simple Library Management System.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask

## CRUD Operations
- Create a new book record
- Read all book records
- Read book by ID
- Update book details
- Delete a book record

## API Endpoints

| POST | /books | Add new book |
| PUT | /books/<id> | Update book |
| DELETE | /books/<id> | Delete book |

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install Flask using:
   pip install flask
3. Run the application:
   python app.py
4. Open browser:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/books

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand REST API concepts and CRUD operations
using Flask in Python.
